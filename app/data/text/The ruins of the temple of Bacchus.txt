The ruins of the temple of Bacchus
Giovanni Battista Piranesi (Mogliano Veneto, 1720 — Rome, 1778)
The ruins of the temple of Bacchus
In Piranesi's time, it was believed that in antiquity it was the temple of Bacchus, because in the 17th century they found an altar dedicated to the god of winemaking. In fact, the history of this small temple is unusual. It was built at his own expense by the Greek orator, sophist, rhetorician Herod Atticus (c. 101 - c. 177). One of the richest men of his time, an Athenian, lived most of his life in Rome, where he owned estates near the Appian Way. Shocked by the death of his wife Aspasia, he built several architectural structures in her memory, including a theater in Athens and a temple in Rome, dedicated to Ceres (goddess of motherhood and marriage, because they had 7 children) and Anna Faustina - recently deceased. the emperor's wife, who was revered as a goddess after her death
