Arch of Constantine
Giovanni Battista Piranesi (Mogliano Veneto, 1720 - Rome, 1778)
Arch of Constantine
Three-aisled arch in Rome between the Colosseum and the Palatine. It was built in 315 to commemorate Constantine's victory over Maxentius at the Battle of Milwaukee Bridge on October 28, 312. It is the last in time to be created from those triumphal arches that have come down to us. This is the only one of its kind, because it was erected in honor of the victory not over an external enemy, but in a civil war. The beginning of the decline of Roman art is manifested in the overload of decor, and its elements are mostly removed from older monuments: the attic is decorated with 8 bas-reliefs, which undoubtedly belong to the time of Marcus Aurelius (161-175). Each column is completed by figures of captured Dacians (probably from the Trajan's Forum). It was during the reign of Constantine that only a relief frieze was created, dedicated to the actual campaign of Constantine against Maxentius.
